## Overview

This Jackson dataformat module will, eventually, allow reading and writing of Java properties
files, as proper POJOs with nested values. Doing that requires use of a naming convention
(except for possible case of "flat" key/value Properties).

## Status

This github project is currently (January 2016) in planning stages.
